In this assiginment I was tasked with improving code, consolidation of unneccessary elements, adding alernate text where needed, and changing the title. I removed a background color that may or may not have been needed. But afterword carefully read the instructions and went from the easist thing to fix(the title), to renaming the div files and attempting to consolidate css properties.

- I was able to learn the basics of html
- How to put together a basic readme file
- Added more specific HTMl elements
- Learned basics of git, github, and gitlab
- Added and Id for search-engine-optimazation

I look forward to continuing to learn different aspects of the course. I hope that I was able to correct the required elements and look forward to feedback. I thought the css looked redundant and but I couldn't figure out how to consolidate.
